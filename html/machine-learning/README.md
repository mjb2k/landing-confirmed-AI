# Machine Learning Element 

# Loosely based off this
https://github.com/prouhard/tfjs-mountaincar/blob/master/src/js/orchestrator.js

- controller.js is loosely equivalent to orchestrator.js, but has more functionality
like move(), and gets the state (which is left to the mountain_car.js in this example)
- Memory and model are the same.
